# UFOs
The purpose of this analysis is to create an HTML website that shows a list of UFO sighting. The HTML page has a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. This table has the ability to filter UFO sighting data based on various criteria. The site was created using JavaScript and HTML.

## Results 
In order to access the UFO sighting information, a user has to open up the index.html file. The index.html file lets the user filter UFO sighting using date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

In the website, there are multiple blank cells where user can type in filter criteria and hit enter. In the following example, I am using "1/10/2010" as the date criteria and "ca" as the criteria for state to display two sightings.

## Summary 
HTML and JavaSrcipt can used to create dynamic websites. A main limitation is the website is able to display data store in a constant data file. 

The site could be improved by:

- Creating a dynamic page that is able to scrape websites or use API to call up to date UFO sightings. 

- Add could add more filtering criteria such duration.
